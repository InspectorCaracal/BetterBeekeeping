# Better Beekeeping

A mod to add some small tweaks to improve the beekeeping experience, including non-damaging hive smoking and a variety of hives based on materials.

*NOTE: This repo is a mirror, not active development.*

## Features

* A new "Bee Smoker" block. Place it under your hive to smoke it like you would a campfire - but without the open flames! Additionally, turn the smoke on or off simply by interacting with the block.
* A full complement of hives for all the vanilla wood planks!
* An alternate recipe for crafting a lead using honey instead of slime, for more peaceful farming play-styles.
* Multiple flavors of honey, each with an extra bit of restorative power!
* Hibernating bees, for that extra bit of realism when playing with seasons and weather mods.

## To-Do

* Hibernation and flavored honeys will get configuration options, allowing them to be turned off if desired.
* Use the datapack functionality for honey flavors, so other mods, players, or datapack builders can add custom mod flowers to make flavored honey
