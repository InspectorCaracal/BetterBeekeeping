# Better Beekeeping

A mod to add some small tweaks to improve the beekeeping experience, including non-damaging hive smoking and a variety of hives based on materials.

**Currently Supported**: 1.18.2, 1.19.2+

*NOTE: This repo is a mirror, not active development.*

## Features

* A new "Bee Smoker" block. Place it under your hive to smoke it like you would a campfire - but without the open flames! Additionally, turn the smoke on or off simply by interacting with the block.
* A full complement of hives for all the vanilla wood planks!
* An alternate recipe for crafting a lead using honey instead of slime, for more peaceful farming play-styles.
* Multiple flavors of honey, each with an extra bit of restorative power!
* Hibernating bees, for that extra bit of realism when playing with seasons and weather mods.

## Compatibility

* Mods can add their flowers to the BBK custom flower tags to allow them to produce flavored honey.
	* The tag format is `betterbeekeeping:spicy_flower` (replace `spicy` with whichever of the honey flavors you wish)
	* It does NOT currently support multiple tags per flower and I don't have plans for changing that.
* Vanilla hives can be converted to BBK hives by placing four planks of the same wood around a vanilla hive.
* Bee hibernation is OFF by default. If you have a seasons mod, turn it on for extra wintry fun!
